# Introduction

The world has recently been affected by the pandemic, Covid-19 that has currently grown to more
than 3 million cases in the world. The growth rate has been exponential. Different countries have
handled the outbreak in different ways, with varying degrees of success.
A recent on-going Kaggle competition provides the data and the incentive to competitors around the
world to predict the pattern of the disease and the course taken by different countries. The aim is to
answer certain key questions regarding the disease and identifying underlying trends.
The time-series data was used in this project to model and forecast the total # of cases into the
future. The main aim was to design a model for the time-series data and forecast the number for the
future. Data was chosen was a single country, India, for this purpose. A R-Shiny dashboard was
designed and built to scale the models to all the countries. This provides the flexibility to the user to
select a country and create a model of their choice to achieve a forecast.

# Data

While the data was provided as part of the Kaggle competition, the original data source is from the
John Hopkins database. The key columns in the dataset include the following information.
- Province and Country – To identify the country, and in a few cases the province
- Date – Daily date for when the observation was recorded
- Confirmed Cases and Fatalities – Total confirmed cases and fatalities on that date

# Approach

Data was taken for India, and the preliminary plots were visualized. Data was from 30th January to
17th April and contains about 79 data points. This was converted into a time-series data object. It is
not surprising to see that there is an increasing trend in the data. Post the initial few days, the
number of cases has risen exponentially (which already suggests non-stationarity). The augmented
Dickey Fuller test results in a p-value of 0.99, and this implies non-stationarity (failed to reject H0).

By intuition, there cannot be a seasonal component as now (and hopefully will not be in the future!).
The ACF suggests slow decay, giving way to a necessity of an ARIMA component, including perhaps a
difference operator.

A differencing of the first order suggests that the mean looks relatively stable. There might be nonconstant variance but the ADF test results in a p-value of 0.01, which is satisfactory. We could
conclude that the data is relatively stationary. This makes the order d = 2.

The new dataset was created with the difference, and once again plotted to visualize the ACF and
PACF plots.

# R Shiny Application

To perform a similar analysis as of that taken for one country, India, the team built an interactive RShiny dashboard that provides insight into the time-series and modelling flexibility. The functionality
of the app is as explained below -

## Data Tab

This tab helps us understand the original data in detail. There are 2 filters in this tab:
- ‘Select a country’ – To choose the country for the COVID 19 forecasts (Default: Afghanistan)
- ‘Select number of rows’ – To choose the number of rows of raw data to be displayed. This
will help in viewing cases and fatalities for a country at a date level. (Default: 10)

There are 3 plots in addition to the display of raw data in this tab. The first plot shows the data as a
time series object for us to understand the pattern in data. The ACF and the PACF plots are displayed
below to understand the lag auto-correlations. These plots also help in building our own model in
the next tab where we have an option to build our own model.

## Model Summary Tab

This tab has an option to either go with the model from the auto.arima function or to build a model
by specifying the values of p, d, and q. Auto.arima is chosen to be the default option as this will give
a starting reference for further adjustments. The default value for building the model is (0,0,0) and
the model will not accept any negative values as input for the values of p, d, and q. Once we make
the required choices, the model summary and the results of the Box-Ljung test are displayed in the
side panel. The former will provide the coefficients of the AR and MA parts of the model and the
latter will check for autocorrelation in the time series residuals.
In addition to this, the residual plots are displayed for diagnostics to check if residuals are
uncorrelated, is stationary and are normally distributed. The model fit values are plotted with the
data for a comparison of how well the model performs.

## Forecast Tab

This tab focusses on generating forecasts from the model built. There is an input field to enter the
number of days into future that we want to forecast and based on this, the forecast is generated
along with the 80% and 95% confidence bands. One can notice how the width of the band increases
when the days of forecast to be included increases.

In addition to this plot, we also have a table in the side panel which shows the values of the forecasts
along with the values for upper and lower bands for 80% and 95% confidence. The minimum number
of days to look at the forecast is set to 0 and the maximum number is set to 30.

The model predicts the increase in the total number of cases over days. This increasing trend suggests the path of the disease if no remedial measures are undertaken,
suggesting the consequences of the inaction. As more and more data are added, one could compare
how the model performs and how the growth rate varies.

The scalable R-Shiny application serves as a good reference and starting point to building
comprehensive models for other countries. While better models might be fit and better diagnostics
may be performed, the dashboard allows for a quick starting point and if not, a simple model that
serves the purpose.

One could improve the models and the forecasts by choosing other measures of making a model
stationarity (like log transform, moving average) and with advanced modelling approaches (ARIMA
with other predictors).
